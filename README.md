\# Crowd Simulation \& Trajectory Modeling



\## Overview

This repository contains my Bachelor's internship on \*\*crowd simulation and trajectory analysis\*\*.  

The main goal is to explore how \*\*Cellular Automaton (CA)\*\* models can simulate pedestrian dynamics, and how \*\*dimensionality reduction methods\*\* (PCA, Diffusion Maps, Variational Autoencoders) can extract meaningful motion patterns.  



Currently, the \*\*neural network part has been completed and uploaded\*\*.  

The other parts (CA simulation and dimensionality reduction) are still under development.  ⚠️ The project is under active maintenance – more code, notebooks, and results will be added progressively.
